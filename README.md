## Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys

In this project we will be working the exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey  and the survey for the DETE, to perform data cleaning tasks in order to extract any meaningful insights from the data.


We'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions:

 *   Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
 *   Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
